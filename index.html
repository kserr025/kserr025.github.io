        <p class="lead mb-4">As an inspiring immigration lawyer, I am seeking to break the bridge in marginalized communities and raise the voices of those who haven't been heard. I aim to bring college preparation and affordable legal assistance for undocumented and minority students. Indeed as a Riverside County native (Perris, specifically) I have witnessed gentrification within my community, such as rent raising, bankruptcy, and evictions within my city. For this reason I strive to uplift the voices of the neglected that are left in the shadows.<br><br>

        I come from the marigolds that shine to lead our loved ones to our home on November first, to the men and women who cross in hopes of reaching their American Dream. I am Mexica; the richness of my culture is present in and out of the country as people migrate North; their culture is never forgotten. My heart belongs to two soils, the soil that roots avocados in Acuitzeramo Michoacan, and the earth that allowed mountains to rise in Perris, Riverside. Both are a place of reassurance for me; Acuitzeramo is a small town where the end of my video call reaches to connect to my family. Perris, the small town of Riverside, is where I spent eighteen years of my life. I have been granted the opportunity to absorb the perspective of both worlds and connect them. I have embodied and have gained an understanding of the struggles of living low income, but I have seen the smiles as my family annually gives back to the small town in Mexico. Indeed, the community in Perris has granted me closure, as I smile at the street vendors on my way to school. Proudly, I come from multiple communities, where richness is represented by what one does, with what one has been granted. 
As a Mexican American woman living in California, I experience racism and systematic stereotypes in both my education and social life. I intend to build a community and provide an inclusive perspective in an area where ideas differ for Hispanic students that suffer similar struggles. As an intended political science major, I want to tackle the learnings of current and past political decisions and their long-term impacts on marginalized communities. I want to be a resource mentor to other students and guide them through local politics and college lifestyle, to implement those subjects towards crafting resources. I hope to bring a new perspective to community discussions by amplifying the voices of neglected experiences; by involving myself in student engagement programs. Specifically, migrant associations, empowering immigrant communities, and creating resources for those individuals. With recruiting me onto your team, it will aid me more towards my dream of becoming an active civic organizer in order to provide for those affected in the Hispanic community and push for diversity in migrant policy decisions.
<br><br>

As a college student, I am currently working at March Middle Schoolto give back to my community as a fellow Avid Tutor to aid young students to encourage them to attend a University or community college
